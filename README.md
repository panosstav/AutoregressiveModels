Time Series Forecasting with SARIMAX and ARIMA Models

This repository contains a Python project focused on Time Series Forecasting using models:
•SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) 
•ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) 

The purpose is to forecast a six-time series (no particular topic) using Python.

Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains such as finance, economics, and environmental science. 
This project provides an in-depth demonstration of how to implement SARIMAX and ARIMA models for accurate time-series predictions.
