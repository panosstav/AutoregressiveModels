Time Series Forecasting with SARIMA and ARIMA Models

This repository contains a Python project focused on Time Series Forecasting using models:
‚Ä¢SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) 
‚Ä¢ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) 

Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains such as finance, economics, and environmental science. 
This project provides an in-depth demonstration of how to implement SARIMA and ARIMA models for accurate time-series predictions.

Scripts:
‚Ä¢sarimax
‚Ä¢arima

Data:
‚Ä¢sample_test
‚Ä¢sample_train
‚Ä¢sample_submission
The data files showcase the desirable format, not the values used.
