## Time Series Forecasting with SARIMAX and ARIMA Models

This repository contains a Python project focused on Time Series Forecasting using models:

‚Ä¢SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors) and

‚Ä¢ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) 

The purpose is to forecast a six-time series (no particular topic) using Python.

Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains such as finance, economics, and environmental science. 
This project provides an in-depth demonstration of how to implement SARIMAX and ARIMA models for accurate time-series predictions.

Scripts:
‚Ä¢sarimax
‚Ä¢arima

Data:
‚Ä¢sample_test
‚Ä¢sample_train
‚Ä¢sample_submission

The data files showcase the desirable format, not the values used.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6+**: You need Python installed on your system to run the code.
- **Pip**: Ensure you have Pip (Python package manager) installed.

Libraries used:

‚Ä¢seaborn üìä

‚Ä¢pandas üêº

## Usage
Here's how you can use the ARIMA time series forecasting code:

1. Data Preparation: Ensure you have the necessary data files:
   
‚Ä¢Place your training data in a CSV file named train.csv.

‚Ä¢Place your test data in a CSV file named test.csv.

‚Ä¢A sample submission CSV file should be named sample_submission.csv.

3. Running the Code: Open and run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform time series forecasting using ARIMA.
4. Model Evaluation: The code includes model evaluation, which will display the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for each ARIMA model.
5. Generating Predictions: After training the ARIMA models, predictions for the test data will be generated and saved.
6. Submission: The predictions can be submitted to a competition or used for further analysis.

## üîÆ Future work:
future work would be Time Series Forecasting with SARIMA model.
